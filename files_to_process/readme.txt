-In this folder, place directories containing CSV files previously converted from STM files
(it is OK if STM or other filetypes are still present).

-Directory trees should be organized such that the top level folder represents an 
EMG Experiment containing folders of EMG Datasets with their own EMG Sessions folders inside. 
STM/CSV files would be found in the lowest (Session) folders.
