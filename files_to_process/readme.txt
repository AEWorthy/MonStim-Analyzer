-In this folder, place directories containing CSV files previously converted from STM files
(it is OK if STM or other filetypes are still present).

-Each directory should correspond to a single M-response/H-reflex recording session 
(in other words, all files should have the same prefix: e.g., "AA86-0000" through "AA86-xxxx").
